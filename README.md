Dotfiles
---------------

This repo is for configuring my terminal environment and other various system settings. It is primarily targeted at macOS and Arch Linux as well as other Unix-like systems. The main toolchain uses is a modernized [Text Triumvirate](https://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate/) integrated with contemporary unix tools like exa, bat, fzf, and ripgrep. It uses Hyper as a terminal for OS cross-compatibility and the excellent Operator Mono font with ligature support and italics thanks to [@kiliman](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig).

## Language Support

Language support is minimal to keep the enviroment as light weight as possible and to allow individual customization. Basic Python, Node.js, Javascript, and Typescript are supported with linters via [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale).
